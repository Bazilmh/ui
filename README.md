# UI
A beginner friendly UI framework which can be used for building UI within seconds.

# What is UI

UI is a UI framework project aimed at improving the UI overhead on designers and developers. By transferring the positioning and other vital design parameters to js, UI aims to create a robust and intelligent ui system
which can change the layout according to screen parameters. Here for UI, we only use css for styling. All the positioning will be done by js. Our end product will be an intelligent UI framework that can adapt to any
screen size without using any css dependent functions.

# Current Development 

UI has just started its development. This will be an open source project which will be available for download to anyone. Anyone can use and give suggestions for improving the framework. Or you can take step forward and
be a part of the development team of UI.
